# h-investigation-data-aquisition-method-1
Investigation to calculate plancks constant using a photo diode. Data aquisition using Matlab for method 1 to calculate the stopping potential. Reverse voltage was applied and the photo voltage measured. Stopping potential was determined with an if statement that recorded the reverse voltage once the photo voltage had dropped below 0.5 percent of the maximum.
