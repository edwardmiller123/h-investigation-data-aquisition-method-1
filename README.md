# h-investigation-data-aquisition-
Investigation to calculate plancks constant using a photo diode.
Data aquisition using Matlab for method 1 to calculate the stopping potential: Reverse voltage was applied and the photo voltage measured. Stopping potential was determined with an if statement that recorded the reverse voltage once the photo voltage had dropped below 0.5 percent of the maximum. 
 
 Method 2: If statement ommitted and initial loop allowed to run through full range of output voltages. As the relationship 
between the root of the photovoltage and the applied voltage was approximately linear, the 
stopping potential for each frequency could be found by taking the intercept of the line of 
best fit with the x axis using the curve fitting tool in Matlab.
